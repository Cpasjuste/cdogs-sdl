This is a special release, including a built-in mod that allows C-Dogs to play Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny!

If you have Wolfenstein 3D or Spear of Destiny installed from Steam or GOG, they will show up in C-Dogs SDL as campaigns!

Alternately you can get the mission pack from the [Downloads page](https://cxong.github.io/cdogs-sdl/downloads.html), which includes the shareware Wolfenstein 3D episode 1.

This mod has been in the making for over a year, and along the way lots of features have been added, including vehicles!

C-Dogs SDL should have been version 1.0 long ago, but this big release was the excuse to finally do it üçæ

Which brings me to sad news; C-Dogs SDL is going into hiatus üòî While it's been really fun working on this game since 2013, I'm ready to move onto different projects. This doesn't mean a complete stop; there will be occasional bug fixes and the like.

Happy gaming!
