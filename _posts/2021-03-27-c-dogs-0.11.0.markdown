Here comes another release of C-Dogs SDL with new features and fixes!

This release adds a new map type: interiors!

Based off BSP/L-system map generators and with Zelda-style lock-and-key placement, this map type simulates the cramped environments of a building interior, with plenty of straight corridors and rooms branching off them. Collect all the keys to make it through from one end of the level to the other!

This map type has been included in the Sand campaign, and is also available in the campaign editor. For a more detailed writeup of this new map type, see the blog post: <http://cxong.github.io/2021/02/bsp-lock-and-key>

Also included in this release are some minor features and bug fixes, like bone-rattle footstep sounds for skeletons, mouse-driven menus, and a nasty crash when changing game options (thanks to [**@viki-t-s**](https://github.com/viki-t-s) for reporting!)

Stay tuned as exciting releases are planned ahead!
