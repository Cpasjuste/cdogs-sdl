This release brings a fresh new look to C-Dogs! Last release we added a chaingun sprite; this release adds weapon sprites for all weapons, which lets you see at a glance what guns the enemies are holding:

Pretty neat huh? There are also some AI enhancements, particularly around waking up:

- Add peripheral vision
- Wake on hearing gunfire nearby
- Wake on seeing someone being attacked

So you can do things like catch a sleeping enemy by sneaking around behind it! Try it out ðŸ¥³
