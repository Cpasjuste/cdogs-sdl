We've had an amazing response to the 1.0 release last week! Thanks to all new and returning players for checking out C-Dogs üëè

As a few folks pointed out, attempting to run Wolfenstein from Windows Steam can crash the game. This release fixes that bug, as well as adding support for Linux Steam.

Last but not least, **Zombie** has set up a [website for sharing C-Dogs campaigns, "Campaign Dogs"](http://cdogs.morezombies.net)!

![Campaign Dogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/gh-pages/_posts/campaign_dogs.jpg)

Here you can download, rate and share custom campaigns, as well as upload high score or speed runs!

**Zombie** runs the [WolfSource / Wolf3D.net community](http://wolf3d.net), a big resource for Wolf3D modding. Please do check it out, especially considering that since C-Dogs SDL supports Wolf3D / Spear of Destiny, it also implicitly supports custom levels made for these games, so who knows ... you might find a whole lot of new content available there!

If you want to be kept up to date, you can follow:
