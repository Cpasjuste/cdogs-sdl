I found an old notebook with C-Dogs sketches during a move, and thought it would be fun to share, given that I've moved on from the project.

C-Dogs was one of my favourite games, so when I got into game dev, it was one of the games I wanted to remake and improve upon. I started collecting ideas and sketches about what a sequel to C-Dogs would have.

The game would have new enemy designs, in a sci-fi, cyberpunk theme. C-Dogs had a great variety of campaigns (zombies, terrorists, orcs, bug-eyed monsters) but thematically it was all over the place. Returning it to a pure sci-fi theme meant cyborgs and robots, heavily-armoured mechs and mech suits. The fast-moving xenomorphs and zombies from C-Dogs were fun but in the new game, they would be replaced with fast-moving and sleek robots with sharp blades for melee weapons.

Gun design would be an important consideration; as C-Dogs is a shooting game, the guns are pretty important, and should be fun and satisfying to use. C-Dogs had an eclectic arsenal, with standard shotguns and machine guns, to sci-fi powerguns, gaming favourites like flamers, and well... the less said about the browny gun, the better. Not so in the new game, which would be filled with futuristic, high powered [fish guns](https://i.imgur.com/XhMYOmZ.jpg) and pew-pew hand cannons. The [MC][mc]'s - who is definitely a cyborg - weapon of choice would be an unassuming SMG, but packed with high-velocity rounds that would shred non-military opponents like cloth. Basically I took lots of notes while watching *Ghost in the Shell*.

[Making plausible guns](http://cxong.github.io/2019/01/how-to-design-a-gun) is one thing but making them legible in a top-down game - where the guns are tiny - would need a different approach. They should have strong silhouettes, so they are recognisable even when they're [a handful of pixels in size](https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-gun-icons-16x16). Turns out [you can do quite a lot with pixels](https://congusbongus.itch.io/tiny-gun-generator).

The game would also have a coherent storyline. In addition to some [frankly silly world-building](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10yS-QoUl2Xa2mMOfuim6vV_KgS9w-FWsRcX7mMWtP38/edit?usp=sharing), the campaign would be highly non-linear: the MC would be thrust into a world with [multiple factions and sub-factions](http://cxong.github.io/2017/08/three-factions), each with their hidden agendas, and depending on which factions the MC is currently working for, the storyline will take different branches, with some levels being playable as a different side with different objectives. For example, work for a certain faction and you would play a level by destroying an objective. Work for a different faction and you would play the same level but guarding that objective.

The notes here are deliberately vague, but the gist is that there's a big MacGuffin that all the factions are vying for, and one of them ends up with it and uses it for good or for awesome. I have since lost the notes for the actual storyline for this epic sci-fi thriller, which is great because it would have just proven what a terrible writer I am.">

C-Dogs's Ogre Rampage is probably many players' first experience of the game, being the first campaign in the list of 5 in the base game. The first level was quite a good intro into the game, throwing the player into a massive firefight with enemy ogres and also plenty of human teammates. New C-Dogs would revamp this classic level but with even more features to ramp up the excitement - enemy ogres busting into a fortified compound via assault vehicles, breaching holes in the walls, and even catapulting infantry over them. Landmarks like radar dishes and watchtowers form cool set piece battles.">
